# Retrieval

The process of giving an LLM more targeted information (context) so you can get more accurate answers.&#x20;

#### What is RAG?

* Retrieval Augmented Generation
* A retrieval system for augmenting LLMs with additional information from external sources.
* Example: Answer questions based on realtime weather data.

#### Why RAG?&#x20;

* Fundamental pieces of AI tool building.&#x20;
* Required for giving you accurate answers to questions.&#x20;



#### What problems does RAG solve?

#### 1. Accuracy & Reliability

* Reduce hallucinations
* Up-to-date data
* Fact-checking

#### 2. Knowledge Enhancement

* Access to proprietary data
* Combine multiple sources of data
* Multimodal data

#### 3. Cost & Efficiency

* Eliminates the need for constant model retraining to incorporate new information
* Reduces costs
* Faster response times



#### Common RAG Examples:

* Retrieve Google Docs: Use LLMs in conjunction with your knowledge base.
* Fetch Customer Data: Fetch critical business information from internal tools.
* Access Live Financial Data: Get live data sources for up-to-date queries.
* Build Memory for Agents: Build a long-term “memory” system for agentic workflows.



Key point: Manage your context window! As context window grows, RAG tools will allow you to maximize the utility of your context window.&#x20;

Run lean.&#x20;

As context&#x20;

RAG vs. Context Windows

* Why does RAG matter as context windows continue to grow?
* RAG works in conjunction with context windows – it’s not either/or.
* Longer context windows give LLMs more “short term memory”.
* RAG allows you to fill that memory.
