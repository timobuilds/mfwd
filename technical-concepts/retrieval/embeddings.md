Make your data (text, images, video, audio, 3D, etc) into a format that e

An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers.&#x20;

The [distance](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#which-distance-function-should-i-use) between two vectors measures their relatedness.&#x20;

Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.



Embeddings are commonly used for:

* **Search** (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
* **Clustering** (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
* **Recommendations** (where items with related text strings are recommended)
* **Anomaly detection** (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
* **Diversity measurement** (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
* **Classification** (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)



Encode semantic information in a number form that can be more easily retrieved.&#x20;
