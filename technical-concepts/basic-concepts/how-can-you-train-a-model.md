Supervised: A model learns patterns from labeled data to make a prediction or classification. Requires you to spend time collecting and

Provides a set of input-output pairs such that we can learn an intermediate system that maps inputs to correct outputs.

* Semi-supervised: aims to address this problem: how do we use a small set of input-output pairs and another set of only inputs to optimize a model for a task that we are solving. Al![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 20.55.27.png>) .![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (1).png>)



Unsupervised: Input data have no corresponding classifications or labelling. The goal is to find underlying high-level patterns with each dataset.

* Self-supervised: No labels given.. However, instead of finding high-level patterns for clustering, self-supervised learning attempts to still solve tasks that are traditionally targeted by supervised learning (e.g., image classification) without any labelings available.



Reinforcement: a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 21.28.04.png>)
