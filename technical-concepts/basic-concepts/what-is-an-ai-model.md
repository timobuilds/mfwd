# What is an AI model?

A model refers to a mathematical representation that captures patterns, relationships, or behaviors in data.

The model essentially **summarizes the knowledge** gained from the training data and can be used for **tasks** like prediction, classification, regression, or generating insights.

Think of a model as a mathematical function that **learns** how to best represent a given set of information.

There are many categories of AI models .

A simple way to think about models in terms of the questions they might be applied to:



| Question for the model to answer. | Algorithm family       | Example                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is this A or B?                   | Classification         | Is this patch of skin cancerous? Yes or no?                   |
| Is this weird?                    | Anomaly Detection      | Is this credit card charge normal?                            |
| How much-or-How many?             | Regression             | What will the Q1 expenses be?                                 |
| How is this organized?            | Clustering             | Which care models have the most break problems?               |
| What should I do next?            | Reinforcement Learning | For a humidity control system: adjust humidity or leave as is |
| Can I create something like that? | Generative             | For a given image/text: generate something similar            |
