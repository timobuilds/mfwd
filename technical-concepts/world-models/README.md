# World Models

A **world model** is an AI system's internal representation of how the world works.&#x20;

It's like having a mental simulation that can predict "what happens next" given a current state and an action.&#x20;

Think of it as the AI's understanding of physics, object permanence, cause-and-effect, and spatial relationships.



#### Types of World Models

**1. Predictive World Models**

**What they do:** Predict future states from current observations

**Example:** Video prediction models that generate next frames

**Use case:** Robotics, autonomous driving



2. **Generative World Models**

**What they do:** Create new, plausible world states from scratch

**Example:** WorldGen creating 3D environments

**Use case:** Content creation, simulation



**3. Interactive World Models**

**What they do:** Simulate how actions change the world

**Example:** Game engines, physics simulators

**Use case:** Planning, reinforcement learning<br>

#### World Models vs. Traditional AI

| Aspect             | Traditional AI                   | World Model AI                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Understanding**  | Pattern matching in data         | Causal understanding of environments |
| **Prediction**     | Statistical correlations         | Physics-based simulation             |
| **Generalization** | Limited to training distribution | Can imagine novel scenarios          |
| **Interaction**    | Reactive responses               | Proactive planning                   |
