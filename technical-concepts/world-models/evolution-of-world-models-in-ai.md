**Current State (WorldGen Era):**

* ✅ Can generate complete, functional 3D environments
* ✅ Understands complex spatial and semantic relationships
* ✅ Maintains consistency across multiple modalities
* ✅ Produces game-engine ready content

**Future Directions:**

* 🔮 Dynamic world models (time-varying scenes)
* 🔮 Interactive world models (respond to user actions in real-time)
* 🔮 Multi-agent world models (populated with AI characters)
* 🔮 Infinite world models (procedural expansion beyond initial generation)

Examples:&#x20;

WorldGen represents a sophisticated world model that understands not just what things look like, but how they relate spatially, functionally, and semantically. By combining diffusion models (for generation) with transformers (for relationship understanding), it creates a rich internal model of how 3D worlds should be structured—then uses this model to generate entirely new, coherent environments from text descriptions.

WorldGen is Meta's groundbreaking system that creates traversable, interactive 3D worlds from simple text prompts. Think of it as DALL-E for entire game environments!
