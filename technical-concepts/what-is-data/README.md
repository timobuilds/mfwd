#### What is Function Calling in LLMs?

Function calling is a feature in advanced language models that allows them to interact with external tools, APIs, or code by generating structured requests (or "calls") to predefined functions, rather than just producing text responses. Think of it as the AI saying, "I need to do something specific—like search the web, calculate a value, or fetch data—so I’ll call a function to handle it." This makes the model more practical and dynamic, extending its capabilities beyond pure conversation.

A collection of numbers, text, images, or any other type of structured or unstructured content that holds meaning and can be processed or used to gain insights.
