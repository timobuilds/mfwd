# Agents

**Introduction to Agents** \
Lay the groundwork for building intelligent, autonomous systems:

* foundational concepts of AI agents
* defining characteristics
* agentic architectures vs. traditional LLM applications,&#x20;



**Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP**\
Expore how agents can 'take action'

* via external functionalities and APIs
* using Model Context Protocol (MCP)\


**Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory**\
Build AI agents that can:

* remember past interactions and maintain context.&#x20;
* Implement short-term and long-term memory to create more robust agents capable of handling complex, multi-turn tasks.

**Agent Quality**\
Build robust and reliable AI agents:

* master the critical disciplines of evaluating and improving agents
* observability, logging, and tracing to provide visibility
* key metrics and evaluation strategies to optimize performance

**Production** \
Deploy and scale AI agents for real-world use.&#x20;

* Best practices for deploying your agents in product&#x20;
* multi-agent systems with the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.
